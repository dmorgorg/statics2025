\begin{frame}{In Practice:}
	\cmini[0.9]{
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In general, we use these equations to find the reactions at connections between a rigid body (not just a particle) and a support.\parm
			\item Often, these support reactions will have three unknowns: a pinned connection with two unknown components; and a connection with a known direction (roller, cable, two-force member, etc.) but an unknown magnitude (and, possibly, unknown sense).\parm
			\item Usually, our first step  after drawing the FBD {\bfseries (!)} is to take moments about the pinned connection to solve directly for the third unknown (the magnitude of the connection with the known direction).\parm
			\item Then we sum the $x$-components of all the forces involved to solve for the $x$-component of the reaction at the pinned connection. We do the same for the $y$-component. \parm
			\item From the components of the reaction at the pinned connection, $R_x$ and $R_y$, we use the Pythagorean Theorem and the inverse tangent function to find the magnitude $R$ and direction $\theta$ of the reaction.

% 			We have three unknowns: $R_{Ax}$, $R_{Ay}$ and $R_B$. Start by taking moments about $A$:

% 			Now, sum the $y$ components to find $R_y$:
% 			\begin{align*}
% 				\Sigma F_y         & = R_{Ay}-3.3\,\text{kN}+1.7058\cos 26.6\degree\,\text{kN} = 0 \\

% 			At this point, there is an opportunity to check our work so far. If we take moments about anywhere (except about $A$ which we've already set to zero), they should sum to zero. Taking moments about $B$ is the most convenient:
