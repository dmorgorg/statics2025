		\begin{itemize}
			\item Much of the study of statics involves the calculations of reaction forces generated between a structural body and its supports when loads are applied.
			\item[]\item There are various connection types used between a structural body and its supports. These connections influence the direction and the sense of the reaction. We shall examine some of these connections now.

			When a structural member or body is supported by a cable (or rope or chain), the cable is assumed to be weightless (and consequently straight) and the cable exerts a reaction on the structural member {\bf in the same direction} as the cable. \parm
			A cable is in tension and can only {\bf pull}; it cannot push. \parm
			There is only one unknown: the magnitude of the force. The direction and sense of the force are known.

			Like a cable, a straight strut (or link) exerts a reaction on a structural member in the direction of the strut. Unlike a cable, a strut can pull  or push.
			\parm
			If we don't know whether a strut is pushing or pulling, we generally assume that the reaction is directed away from the structural member (pulling, in tension). If our calculations then determine that $F$ is negative, the direction is opposite to our assumption (i.e., pushing) (b).
			\parm
			As with the cable, there is only one unknown. The sign of $F$ determines the  sense of $F$.
