			\item In general, we use these equations to find the reactions at connections between a rigid body (not just a particle) and a support.\parm

			\item Usually, our first step  after drawing the FBD {\bfseries (!)} is to take moments about the pinned connection to solve directly for the third unknown (the magnitude of the connection with the known direction).\parm
			\item Then we sum the $x$-components of all the forces involved to solve for the $x$-component of the reaction at the pinned connection. We do the same for the $y$-component. \parm
			\item From the components of the reaction at the pinned connection, $R_x$ and $R_y$, we use the Pythagorean Theorem and the inverse tangent function to find the magnitude $R$ and direction $\theta$ of the reaction.

			\item  For a body in equilibrium, $\Sigma M=0$ for moments summed about {\bfseries any} point in the plane containing the body.\pars
			\item We have used all the three equations of statics to solve for three unknowns. It would also have been possible to solve using $\Sigma M=0$ three times by choosing appropriate points about which to take moments. There are occasions when it is more convenient to sum moments two or three times, rather than summing components. (We will see this when using the Method of Sections to analyze forces in truss members.)\pars
			\item Since there are only three equations for statics, we can only solve a system for three unknowns. Frequently, two unknowns come from a pinned connection and the third from a cable, roller or some other connection whose reaction direction is known. (Alternatively, we can solve for a fixed connection, which has three unknowns.)\pars
			\item Generally, we start by taking moments about the pinned connection - so that we don't need to consider the moments of the pinned connection unknowns. Then, the moment equation will immediately give a solution for the third unknown, e.g., for a connection with a known force direction.

				The bin of a dump-truck is being tipped by hydraulic lift $AB$. ($AB$ can be considered a two-force member.) The bin rotates about a pin at $C$. Determine the force in the lift $AB$ and find the reaction at $C$ if the bin has a mass of $880\,\textsf{kg}$ and $G$ marks its centre of mass.
