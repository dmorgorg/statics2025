		\item Identify zero-force members, if any.\pause
		\item Check the truss for symmetry. Symmetrical trusses may only need half the number of calculations!\pause
		\item Select the first joint to be analyzed and draw its free-body diagram.
		      \begin{itemize}
		      	\item The joint must have no more than two connecting members with unknown internal forces.
		      	\item Often start at a support where the external reactions are known.
		      \end{itemize}\pause
		\item Use $\Sigma F_x=0$ and $\Sigma F_y=0$ to find the internal forces in the connecting members.\pause
		\item Mark the calculated forces on the free body diagram of the whole truss so that the next joint may be selected
		      for analysis.\pause

		\item Repeat until all the joints have been analyzed and the internal forces in each of the truss members is
		      known.\pause
