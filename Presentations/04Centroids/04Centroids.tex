	\begin{itemize}
		\item Finding the {\bfseries centroid} of an area is important in studying the strength of a structural member. (This will be covered in detail in the Strength of Materials course next semester, and in structural courses in the second year of the programme.)\parb
		\item Why learn it now?
		      \pause
		      \parm
		      \begin{itemize}
		      	\item Centroids are used in the analysis of {\bfseries distributed loads}, an important part of statics (and future courses!). \parb\pause
		      	\item The forces we have considered so far have been {\bfseries concentrated loads}, meaning that each force acts at (is concentrated at) a single point. Distributed loads are spread out, e.g. snow on a roof, water against side of a swimming pool, wind on the wall of a building.

\begin{frame}{The Centre of Gravity}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  A body is made up of infinitely many small elements, each having a weight (a downward force due to gravity).\parb
		\item The resultant of these parallel forces is also downward and the line of action of this resultant goes through a point called the {\bfseries centre of gravity}. \parm
		\item The centre of gravity may be considered as the `balance point' for the body. It is the point where the total weight of the body acts.
