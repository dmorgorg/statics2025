	\small
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Mechanics is a branch of physics dealing with bodies that are subject to forces.
		\item Statics is the branch of mechanics that deals with bodies that are in {\bf equilibrium}.
		\item Bodies in equilibrium are either {\bf static} (not moving, or at rest) or are moving with a constant velocity.
		\item In this course, we are interested in the forces necessary to keep a body at rest.
		\item We only consider forces in the plane, i.e. this course is limited to bodies described in only two dimensions (2-D), not those described in space (3-D).
		\item Furthermore, these bodies are assumed to be {\bf rigid}. That is, they do not deform when loads are applied. In practice, structural members {\bf do} deform when loaded but, if correctly designed, deformation is generally minimal and we can ignore the slight geometrical changes.
		\item Unless otherwise noted, structural bodies are presumed to have no weight. We do this because the weight of the body is generally small compared to the loads imposed. %A wooden residential truss can support 15-20 times its own weight.
