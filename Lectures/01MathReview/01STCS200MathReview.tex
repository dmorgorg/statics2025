		This is a simple system of simultaneous equations:

		Equation (1) is a straight line, with slope $-2/3$, that intersects the $x$ axis at $x=3.5$ and intersects the $y$ axis at $y=7/3$. \parm
		Equation (2) is a straight line, with slope $6$, that intersects the $x$ axis at $x=1/6$ and intersects the $y$ axis at  $y=-1$. \parm
