      \parm\pause
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $2.3456$ becomes $2.35$ because the first non-significant digit (the $5$ in
				this case) is $\ge 5$ and so the $4$ rounds up.\pars
				\item $2.3446$ becomes $2.34$ because the first non-significant digit (the $4$ in
				this case) is $< 5$ and the last significant digit, $4$, remains unchanged.
			\end{itemize}
			\item When the first discarded digit is a $5$ (or higher), round up the digit
			before the $5$ (or higher)\parm
			\item There are various rules (such as the odd-even rule) which take a
			more complicated approach to rounding $5$ but, for our purposes, $\bm 5$ {\bf rounds up}!
